// ////////////////// RULE ////////////////////////////////

/**
 * An {@link Engine} contains a list of rules.  The engine 
 * can then be asked to provide the outcome of the Action associated with the best 
 * matching rule (see {@link Engine#executeBestAction}), 
 * or to provide a list of matching rules (see {@link Engine#getMatchingRules}).  
 * Each rule is "evaluated"
 * by using the {@link #expression} supplied in the constructor 
 * {@link Rule}.
 * The expression must be valid expression language.  During evaludation, 
 * the input object passed to the engine is mapped to the name "input", which can be
 * used in the rules.  For example, consider the following rule:&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code>input.person1.name == "ant" &amp;amp;&amp;amp; input.person1.gender == "male"&lt;/code>&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * Note how the rule evaluates to "true" or "false".  For any rule to be a candidate
 * to have an associated {@link IAction} executed, it must evaluate to "true".  The rule in the 
 * example above requires an input object which conforms to the bean specification, and 
 * which is composed of an object named "person1", which has attributes"name"
 * and "gender".  If an input object is supplied to the engine such that this rule
 * evaluates to true, then it is a candidate to have its action run, either by 
 * the engine, when {@link Engine#executeBestAction} is called, 
 * or by the application, when {@link Engine#getMatchingRules}
 * returns the rule and the application decides to run the action.&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * Rules belong to namespaces, so that a single engine can be used to evaluate rules 
 * from different components within an application.  within a namespace, all rules must
 * have unique names (this is checked when adding rules to an engine).  The reason is that
 * rules can be composed of {@link SubRule}s and when they are composed in that manner, 
 * rules refer to subrules by their names.&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * A rule has a priority too.  In certain cases, where the application only requires the 
 * best rule to be used, the priority helps the application decide which rule to run 
 * when there is more than one match.&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * The description in a rule is imply to aid in rule management.&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * Typically rules are customisable at runtime using some kind of administration UI.
 * While this framework does not provide an out of the box framework, it has been 
 * designed such that the rules could be created from a persistent store.
 * It is entirely conceivable that an application would load rules from a database
 * and execute existing actions based on the rules.  Only when a new action is 
 * required, would an application need to be upgraded and redeployed.&lt;br>
 * 
 * @constructor
 * @author Ant
 * @property name {String} The name of the rule.  Should be unique within the namespace (tested when adding rules to the {@link Engine}).
 * @property expression {String} A Javascript rule. All variables must come from the object called "input".  The rule MUST evaluate to "true" if it is to be a candidate for execution.
 * @property outcome {Object} Normally a string, this is the name of an action to run, if this rule is the winner or this is the result of calling the method {@link Engine#getBestOutcome}.
 * @property priority {int} The priority of a rule is used when sorting the matching rules.  A higher number indicates a higher priority and that causes the rule to be placed nearer the start in the Array of matching rules.  If the best outcome is being determined, or the best action, then it is the outcome/action at index 0 of the matching rules which is used.
 * @property namespace {String} The namespace of this rule, for example a version number or component name. 
 *  When the engine is used, the caller supplies an optional namespace pattern (regular expression) which is used 
 *  to filter the rules which are used in determining outcomes.
 * @property description {String} An optional description of the rule, helpful for managing rules.

// ////////////////// ENGINE ////////////////////////////////

/**
 * A Rule Engine.  Can evaluate rules and execute actions or simply provide an 
 * ordered list of the best matching {@link Rule}s.&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * A fuller explanation of how to use rules can be found in the documentation for {@link Rule}s.&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * Imagine a tarif system which your business needed to be highly configurable.
 * The business wants to be able to specify new tarifs or update existing ones
 * at any time.  The criteria used to determine which tarifs are relevant
 * to a customer wanting to make a purchase are based on the attributes belonging 
 * firstly to the person, and secondly to their account.  For example, a customer
 * who is under 26 is eligible for a youth tarif.  Seniors are eligible for their own
 * tarif too.  Additionally, customers who do not get a youth or senior tarif
 * are entitled to a loyalty tarif if they have had an account for more than 24 months.&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * These business rules can be modelled in a database as a set of strings.  The data 
 * can then be loaded and modelled in the code using the {@link Rule} API. 
 * Consider the following four rules:&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * &lt;code>
 * var r1 = new Rule("YouthTarif",&lt;br>
 * &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"input.age &amp;lt; 26", "YT2011", 3,&lt;br>
 * &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"ch.maxant.someapp.tarifs");&lt;br>
 * var r2 = new Rule("SeniorTarif",&lt;br>
 * &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"input.age &amp;gt; 59", "ST2011", 3,&lt;br>
 * &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"ch.maxant.someapp.tarifs");&lt;br>
 * var r3 = new Rule("DefaultTarif",&lt;br>
 * &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"!#YouthTarif &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !#SeniorTarif", "DT2011", 3,&lt;br>
 * &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"ch.maxant.someapp.tarifs");&lt;br>
 * var r4 = new Rule("LoyaltyTarif",&lt;br>
 * &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"#DefaultTarif &amp;amp;&amp;amp; input.account.ageInMonths &amp;gt; 24",&lt;br>
 * &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"LT2011", 4,&lt;br>
 * &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;"ch.maxant.someapp.tarifs");&lt;br>
 * &lt;/code>
 * &lt;br>
 * The following object model can then be created and used to evaluate the rules.&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * &lt;code>
 * var request = {person: {name: "p", age: 35}, account: {ageInMonths: 25}};
 * &lt;/code>
 * &lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * The following code can then be used to determine the best tarif, or list of all matching tarifs:&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * &lt;code>
 * //will return both DT2011 and LT2011, since both are relevant.&lt;br>
 * //Since LT2011 has a higher priority, it is first in the list.&lt;br>
 * var matches = engine.getMatchingRules(request);&lt;br>
 * &lt;br>
 * // returns "LT2011", since the loyalty tarif has a higher priority&lt;br>
 * var tarif = engine.getBestOutcome(request); &lt;br>
 * &lt;/code>
 * &lt;br>
 * See {@link Rule} for more details.  See the tests for more examples!
 *
